#  Introduction

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a standard application layer protocol that functions as a request-response protocol between server and client.

It is widely used in IoT (Internet of Things) embedded applications, where every sensor is connected to a server and we have access to control them over the internet.

NodeMCU has Wi-Fi functionality available on board. With this Wi-Fi functionality, NodeMCU can connect to any wi-fi network as a client or it can create a network to which other wi-fi enabled devices can connect.

NodeMCU as HTTP Server using Wi-Fi STA mode
NodeMCU has Station (STA) mode using which it can connect to the existing wi-fi network and can act as an HTTP server with an IP address assigned by that network
